<h1>Rebasing </h1>


<h3>Rebasing branches </h3>
When we are rebasing branches, we're putting one branch on top of another one.
 ```console
 $ # rebase the Sarah branch on top of the master branch
 $ git rebase master
 ```
In Git, each commit has a unique identifer. The unique identifier is a hash that contains information about the commit
and makes it possible for us to interact with the specific commits. When we merge branches, the identifiers won't be modified. In order words,
we are not modifying the history of our Git commits when we're merging.

When we rebase branches, we're actually copying the commits from one branch to another. Since we're creating new copied commits, the hashes update. 
We are modifying the Git history when we are rebasing the branches.

<h3>Interactive Rebasing </h3>
We can change the histoy of a Git branch with an interactive rebase.
 ```console
 $ # interactively rebase the last four commits
 $ git rebase -i HEAD~4
 pick fb9f191 Added second story
 pick aaba5e7 Changes to second story
 pick 8ad5d7b Oops more changes to second story
 pick 6a6f68b More changes to second story
 ```
Git will show a lot of commands that are availalbe when rebasing interactively. We will be using the squash command to merge the three commits into the first commit.
In order the squash the commits. we have to change their commands from pick to squash.
 ```console
 $ git rebase -i HEAD~4
 pick fb9f191 Added second story
 squash aaba5e7 Changes to second story
 squash 8ad5b7b Oops more changes to second story
 squash 6a6f68b More changes to second story
 ```

<h3>Cherry Picking </h3>
Cherry-picking is the process of selecting a specific commit from one branch and applying it as a new commit onto your current branch. 
 ```console
 $ git cherry-pick aaba5
 ```
